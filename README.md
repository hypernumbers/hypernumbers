hypernumbers
============

Hypernumbers is a Spreadsheet Platform.

It is largely compatible with Excel '97  and your users already know how to use it.

But it solves the following 5 benefits to using a desktop spreadsheet.

Benefit 1
---------

You get better and swifter access to correct information which leads to a more responsive organisation making better decisions with more confidence.

Because you can publish spreadsheet pages as web pages with a single click which leads to information being shared without fear of it being corrupted.

Benefit 2
---------

By making data collection and aggregation cheap and reliable (as opposed to the cumbersome manual process in normal spreadsheets) you can increase the manageability of distributed processes which means they can be improved

Because you can turn spreadsheets into data entry forms/wiki pages with a single click which leads to Information being collected and aggregated from many individuals and sites in a simple, secure and verifiable way with full audit and transparency.

Benefit 3
---------

Simple management of roles and permissions allows for business processes in Hypernumbers to be deployed in a vey straightforward and unproblematic manner - even when then involve 1,000s of spreadsheets

Because Hypernumbers has a shared Role Based Access Control (RBAC) permission system which works across all its spreadsheets which means Iindividuals can be added to groups once and then have access to all that their role requires them to use.

Benfit 4
--------

Easy aggregation means the end of ‘under management’ where critical insights are buried in core operational spreadsheets from which they are never extracted due to cost and time constraints.

Becuase Hypernumbers spreadsheets can be organised hierarchically and then queried and summarised using special spreadsheet functions this means that data can be simply rolled-up, aggregated, compared and managed.

Benefit 5
---------

Simple, automatic and full audit enables flexible ‘trust and verify’ systems to be built without fear of gaming or other manipulative problems that arise in ‘easy to cheat, hard to get caught’ spreadsheets.

Because All changes by all users are logged automatically it is possible to look at the history of all changes to a particular cell, or all changes by a particular person.
