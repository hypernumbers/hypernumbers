    <h1>The Home Page Of The User</h1>
    <p>This would be built by the View Builder, blah-blah....</p>
    <p>This page is read only by the user and is where the 'system' keeps all its user information, eg password, address other details.</p>
    <p>The user can update certain bits of information using a form with the transactional security restricting what they can update.</p>
