%% this is a permissions script for creating and adding users to groups.
%%

{create_group, [{name, "admin"}]}.
{create_group, [{name, "user"}]}.
{create_group, [{name, "guest"}]}.
{create_group, [{name, "test1"}]}.
{create_group, [{name, "test2"}]}.

% two syntaxes for this
% use a uid for an existing user or use an email with a password
% and it will create a user with that password
% (kinda needed for testing)
% {add_user, [{uid, "someUID"}, {group, "test1"}]}.
{add_user, [{email, "test@hypernumbers.com"},
            {group, "test1"},
            {password, "i!am!secure"}]}.
{add_user, [{email, "debug@hypernumbers.com"},
            {group, "admin"},
            {password, "i!am!secure"}]}.

% ditto for set_users 2 syntaxs
%{set_users, [{group, "test2"}, {uids, ["test@hypernumbers.com"]}]}.
{set_users, [{group, "test2"}, {emails, ["test@hypernumbers.com"]}]}.
