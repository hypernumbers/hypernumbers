HOW TO GENERATE THE FNS
-----------------------

There is a spreadsheet file that contains the json generator:
* funs_en_gb.xls

To generate a new version of the JSON .hrl file:
* copy column A (from row 3 down) into a text editor and save as a text file in this directory
* run the escript file 'test_json' with the filename of the text file of json terms

'test_json' will check that each record is valid json, and if it is, it will write a copy of the file 'funs_en_gb.hrl' into this directory

Copy that file into $GITHUB/lib/hypernumbers-1.0/include/ and recompile, voila!
