          <h2>Spreadsheets as Urls</h2>
          <p>Hypernumbers allows you to organise your spreadsheets in a flexible
            way similiar to a file system. Under the <em>My Spreadsheets</em> 
            menu you can create new spreadsheets and view existing ones, 
            including publicly shared spreadsheets.</p>
          <br />
          <div class="img"><img src="/hypernumbers/myspreadsheet1.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>You can use these url addresses when linking to cells on other
            spreadsheets, you can find out more about that on the next page.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="intropage">
          <h2>HyperNumbers</h2>
          <p>Using data from other spreadsheets is easy, select the cells
            you are interested and copy them using: right click &gt; Copy, 
            edit menu &gt; Copy or Ctrl+C</p>
          <div class="img"><img src="/hypernumbers/copy.png" /></div>
          <p>Then select where you want the cells to go, and use "Paste Links" 
            from the edit menu or right click menu. The data will update as 
            if it were a link on the same spreadsheet.</p>
