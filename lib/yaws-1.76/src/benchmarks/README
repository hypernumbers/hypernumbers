Benchmarks for yaws_server as discussed in the 'Benchmarking' section of the OTP 'Efficiency Guide'

In an erl shell run from the benchmarks folder:
--------------------------
1> c(bench).
{ok,bench}
2> bench:run().
Compiling conc_path_bm.erl...
Compiling bench.erl...
Compiling all.erl...
Running conc_path_bm: conc_path_orig conc_path_tail conc_path_lappend conc_path_lflatten conc_path_lconcat
ok
--------------------------
This should generate an index.html file in this folder showing the relative performance.


See conc_path_bm.erl for a trivial example that may be useful as a base.
