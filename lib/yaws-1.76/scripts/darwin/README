Yaws startup on MacOS X / Darwin

Doing `make install' as root will create a `Yaws' StartupItem in
/Library/StartupItems.

By default, yaws startup is disabled. To enable it, edit (as root)
/etc/hostconfig and add the line

    YAWS=-YES-

Yaws startup can be disabled by changing the line to

    YAWS=-NO-

Yaws will start automatically on reboot. You can manually test the
startup without rebooting by issuing the command (as root) in a
terminal window

    $ SystemStarter start Yaws


Stop the server by issuing:

    $ SystemStarter stop Yaws

Reload the server with the command

    $ SystemStarter restart Yaws
