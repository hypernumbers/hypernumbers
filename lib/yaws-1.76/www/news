CGI should not just because it sees a Location: header do a 302, it is up the CGI script to set the correct status code (Sebastian strollo)

Sloppy ssl bug found by John Webb

Wed Sep 19 23:17:47 CEST 2007 1.72
Even more bad properties found. Now all png, gif and wob (those are for the wiki) files have svn:mime-type application/octet-stream and no other properties. Finally fixed I hope.

Regular bugfix and small feature release.
Revproxy bug found by igor goryachev.
Started to use the new ssl:transport_accept()  function, when accept fails, We now fail yaws entirely and it needs to be restarted by its supervisor or heart. If we have filedescriptor leaks, even outside of  yaws, there is no good thing to do when accept fails. (klacke)
A body message patch from Brian Templeton which cleaned up code and improved RFC 2616 compliance
Added HTTPS env variable for trac (klacke)

added a dir_listing function in yaws_api (klacke)
fixed yapp dependencies to vdir handling, added local stylesheet and updated yapp_intro documentation (mikaelk)

Forgot to update configure after the patch to configure.in for ubuntu edgy users in 1.67
Patch by Julian Noble to pass auth info over the CGI interface.

Patch from Fredrik Thulin to make setuid_drv work better under ubuntu where gcc with some stack smashing tech is used to build, then we cannot use ld, we need to use ggc to greate the shared object.
Appmod </, Mod> didn't work properly. Should be fixed now again !!!!!
RSS The generated content was not valid RSS 2.0 content (tobbe)
added ability  to have config files in several files, patch from Sergei Golovan.

Extending yaws_api:find_cookie_val/2 to accept an #arg record as second argument as well. (tobbe)
tweaked the haXe documentation (yariv)

patch by Chris NewCombeto handle PUT method better.
Yapp added. Yaws application (Yapp) handler in yaws/applications/yapp directory "Drops" web applications independently of each other into an existing server where they get the default URL http://servername/application_name/. Yapps are simply Erlang/OTP applications with web pages in their priv/docroot directory (default). One can also configure private appmods, useful for controller parts in MVC like applications. (Mikael Karlsson)
Haxe. Now compatible  with the latest version of haXe. (yarivvv)
New support to start Yaws as in embedded mode without having to fiddle with the boot script (etnt)
patch from Matthew Reilley to handle new backwards non-compatible return value from OTP zlib:deflate/4
patch from anders nygren to handle absolute paths + yssi.
patch from Magnus froberg to get better control over the files generated by 'yaws --check'. This is good if one wants to run i.e. xref and dialyzer also on all the generated .erl files from the --checker.
empty array bug in json parse found by juhani and fixed by gaspar.
appmod '/' was broken (klacke)
Install, netbsd/yaws.sh: NetBSD support from Kuzma Bartosz.

JSON Ajax code from Gaspar Chilingarov, I added docs describing an example. (klacke)
run_erl and to_erl support patch from Mats Cronquist. 
yaws_zlib.erl: some bugs in non used code found by dialyzer.
small fixes in the start script code (klacke)
Fixes from Mikael Karlsson adding an event manager to Yaws whereby it is possible to add user defined gen_event handlers handling different "events" from Yaws. The only event sofar is config changes. This is needed for mikls "yapp" project which is a way to write yaws packages that can be "dropped" into an existing server. (No docs or anything released yet)

Thu Apr 27 21:40:01 CEST 2006 Version 1.61
Started to write the ctl file, the file which contains the portnumber where the daemon is listening for ctl command to - /var/run/yaws/ctl-${ID}. The location is controllable through configure. Install scripts will make the /var/run/yaws dir writable to the world, each individual daemon which creates the ctl file will explicitly set the permissions on the ctl file to 600 - thus making it impossible for unauthorized users to control someone elses daemon. Root can control all daemons.
changed Yaws license to proper BSD (klacke)
Added startup script for FreeBSD
Worked the Makefiles to properly support DESTDIR. This is useful for packagers creating deb, rpm, portage ... packages  (klacke)
Removed the ability to change userid. Also stopped writing to /tmp/yaws and started to write to ${HOME}/.yaws instead. This is much better since we cannot now ever get into the situations where file ownership and umask stop us from controlling a daemon. Note, this is a backwards incompatible change, all users that used the feature of letting Yaws change uid need to start using fdsrv instead. There is also a configurable in yaws.conf which makes it possible to write the tmp files to some other directory  (klacke)
Cleaned up the start flags to the yaws script, all old flags are still there for backward compatibility. Updated docs and and help output from the yaws script to reflect all new flags. 
Wiki fixes.  Fixed error printouts; handle https and        ftp links; updated READE (mbj)
file descriptor leak bug found by Mats Cronqvist where each call to 'yaws -ls' left an unclosed descriptor in the server (klacke)
Source code cleanup - added and #env record for environment passed to yaws. (klacke)
yaws_ls enhancements by        doccarcass@gmail.com

Wed Feb  1 23:28:42 CET 2006 Version 1.58
pam and setuid_drv fixes for BSD by sstrollo
yaws_ls (dir listing) enhancements by doccarcass@gmail.com
RSS updates, more docs, Made month and days in RSS output to consist of	two figures instead of just one. Fixed the RSS date format, as	suggested by Daniel Kaminski. (Tobbe)
Wiki, Fixed path to the application directory where yaws files are stored. (mikl)
Added feature to not pick first sconf when virthosting. This is essential if we want explicit control over the virt hostnames. A commercial site called http://www.serious.com don't want http://fuckme.serious.com to ship the pages of the serious site :-) (klacke)
DAV - reworked the DAV support a bit - don't use an appmod, instead yaws	has built-in support for DAV methods.  Added support for missing	DAV methods (COPY etc). (mbj)
Added support for the erlmerge/jungerl package 'fdsrv' which makes it possible to bind to privileged ports < 1024 even when we're not running as root. (klacke)
changed so that an arg_rewrite_mod may	temporarily change the docroot by changing the Arg#arg.docroot	attribute (mikl)
Added "pam" support for HTTP auth. (klacke)

Wed Aug 17 14:54:06 CEST 2005 Version 1.57
rel/abs path patch by Rob Schmersel which fixed	a problem in the wiki
Rewrote yaws SSL code to use the packet http and packet line modes that are now supported in the OTP	ssl module. Earlier this was all manual (and slow) code in yaws.	Thus yaws/SSL servers are now considerably faster. The old yaws_ssl modules is no longer used. (klacke)
Support clients that POST data with Transfer-Encoding chunked. This is used by some models of cellphones. Bug found by ermine@ermine.pp.ru (Klacke)
Tmp dir patch by Karel Ostrovsky to better support tmp dir on Windows
cgi port patch by joe_e_e
Do not send the server	port along with the host name in the CGI HTTP_HOST environment	variable. Added HTTP_HOST env variable for CGI 	scripts (was required by sphpblog). (mikl)


Thu Jun 16 13:42:50 CEST 2005, Version 1.56, Security update release.
A bug was found by Daniel Fabian, SEC-Consult Unternehmensberatung GmbH whereby: If a null byte is appended to the filename of a yaws script (.yaws), the yaws webserver returns a page containing the source code of the  according script. This flaw allows a malicious attacker to analyse the source code of the entire web application, which might result in the attacker gaining sensitive information like passwords. All versions of yaws older than 1.56 are vulnerable.
For users running old yaws web servers, the following <a href="yaws-1.55_to_1.56.patch"> patch </a> can be applied. The patch is small and can easily be back ported to older yaws releases.

Fri Jun 10 16:09:58 CEST 2005, Version 1.55 released. Feature release.
Concept of redirect maps added. See documentation in yaws.conf man page. This makes it possible to redir entire parts of the docroot to another site (jb)
Removed the forbidden code, the right thing	to do when a script type is forbidden and we shall not run an	interpreter on the script is to ship the script, but as text/plain	instead of actually refusing to ship the data. Otherwise it's not	possible to publish .php files at all on the web site. (klacke)
Initial support for Web DAV added. This is as of yet undocumented. (tobbe)
Added the possibility to have multiple	docroots, where a page is searched in the list of docroots (klacke)

Tue Apr 12 2005, Version 1.54 released. Bugfix release.
Bug in SSL fixed, Bad line parsing in SSL mode, crashed when client sent headers split up in a certain way. (klacke)
Removed the automatic htmlize on strings in  ehtml, it was wrong ... to have it there. It's better for users that want it to explicitly add yaws_api:htmlize() to their strings This breaks code and is non backwards compatible.  Be aware !!  Also made {Tag, Attr} generate xhtml compliant code. (klacke)
Cleaner shutdown (klacke)
Many improvements to the chat server. (jb)
When clearing the cache, yaws modules would remain loaded but be forgotten, resulting in a memory leak. (cschultz)
Added possibility to name the module in a .yaws file using a syntax of < erl module="foobar"> .... < /erl> to always get a .yaws file named to a special fixed module name instead of the increasing m1,m2 .. modulenames. This is useful if we want to keep API functions in certain .yaws files and call these functions from other .yaws files. (klacke)
Many reverse proxy bugs fixed. Maybe the reverse proxy is actually working now. It was never especially good. Try it. (mikl)
Bug fixed with bindings that        got propagated over to other later requests.Yet another put/get bug. Maybe it's time for an acronym there. YAPGB ??? (klacke)
Better looking debug printouts.  + dont overwrite trace_to_tty (-x commandline) if set on the        commandline and also in the config file.  Commandline should have        precedense over config file directives. (klacke)
Wrote an internals document. Available at <a href="http://yaws.hyber.org/internals.yaws"> http://yaws.hyber.org/internals.yaws</a> (klacke)

Fri Feb 18, 2005 Bugfix release
Fatso bug found by Fredrik Linder where	yaws completely crash on bad URLs that for example contain space chars in the uri. This is the bug which provoked this imideate followup release. (klacke)
Removed old broken URL decode code which was wrong. This code was added befor we actually understood how URLs are en/de coded (klacke, jb)
Added example chat program (jb)
Added new config opt fail_on_bind_err = Bool. The old behaviour was to silently accept (and log) server startup errors. This was due to a request from Tony Rogvall and the behaviour is bad, it's now back to the original behaviour where the entire yaws "application" fails if one virt server fails to gen_tcp:listen(). 

Mon Feb 14 2005, Version 1.52 released
Minor feature release
error condition bug in revproxy, found by tobbe. Revproxy is still not production quality. Experimental.
embedded bugfix by Michael Arnoldus
connection close bug found by Lennart Ostman
made errorlog actually go out when conf is brokbroke e + daemon (klacke)
Yaws is now RSS capable, see doc/README.rss (tobbe)
Added a new example look and feel for the wiki (jb)
Webmail, Fixed problem 	with login with empty fields in FireFox. (jb)
wiki, Fixed minor unzip problem triggered when uploading zip archives with names containing spaces. (jb)

Wed Dec 15 2004 Version 1.51 released
Major feature release.
Added support for config changes without stopping the running systems, virt servers can be added, removed and changed without affecting traffic. (klacke)
wiki/searchPage.yaws: Added search code from Jouni Ryno (jb)
Added client IP resolv for access log files (klacke)
Safer make install target. Can't install if yaws is running (klacke)
Updated both mail and wiki according to changed	APIs for parse_multipart. (jb)

Sat Dec 11  2004 Version 1.50 released
Bugfix and docs release
Running the wiki at the yaws site. Use it !!. No passwords.... 
<verbatim> tag added, this tag pretty much works as <pre> _should_ have worked. Nothing needs to be escaped,  and code containing <, >, & etc can be entered freely.  Writing code examples were driving me crazy. Inside both <pre> and <code> tags all HTML special chars have to be quoted, sucks. (klacke)
Rewamped all docs with CSS and XHTML 1.0, beautiful and nice (klacke)
Attach file problem in wiki (jb)
Form post parameter was still always managed as atoms. This is a backwards incompatible change. It broke the wiki aswell as the upload example in the Yaws docs.However, the change is sound since it was easy to DOS a yaws server by sending file upload posts with new atoms. Eventually the atom table would overflow. However it does break code !!!  (mikl)
Added auto-generate all.zip to dir listings.  It needs the zip command in  the current path to function properly. To turn off, use    dir_listsings = true_nozip. This is a feature for all of us that like to share copyrighthed material to friends that can't muster wget -r (mbj)
Added relative path to ssi, ie {ssi,  {rel_path, File}, ...} is now possible. (jb)
mail app, Fixed refresh bug. (jb)
Added example docs on how to stream data (klacke)
modded patch by sebastian strollo to let  request_url/1 and reformat_url/1 be proper inverses of each other (klacke)
 Made upgrading to   new style Wiki templates smooth. If no template.html file exists in  the WikiPreferences.files directory, then one is created. The same   goes for template_info.html. (jb)

Thu Sep  2, 2004 Version 1.49 released
Bugfixrelease.
Webmail fixes by jb, Add original message quoted in reply, Delete email bug fixed, Mailbox already locked bug, Improved attachment handling.
Wiki fixes by jb, Made layout of wiki much more configurable using templates and ssi. You must run the script/updateWiki script after updating to this release.
Bug found by David Welton, url on the form	http://www.x.com?foo had yaws_api:queryval/2 return {nokey, "foo"}	which is clearly wrong. New correct val is {"foo", undefined}.
two-mode.el contributed by David Welton. Makes it easier to edit files with both erlang and html content. Typically the case for yaws files.
cschultz did lots of stuff, Deflate rehaul:  Now works with dynamic pages, Multiple dots in yaws file name	caused trouble with pathinfo, fixed silly bug with content-range, cache fixes, Have several processes wait for SSL	connections, so that one SSL negotiation in progress does not	prevent other connections.  Also, for the similar reasons, have use	a timeout with SSL accepts.	timeout are quite arbitrary.  They are ok for my low traffic site. Streaming fixes, Rewrite requests with absolute URI to look	like requests with a Host header.
Small fix with embedded mode (it was completely non-working) by Jimmy Olgeni
Addded configure option	-with-defaultcharset (klacke)
jb fixed a severe bug in ssi, Fixed bug in ssi code. Multichar delims were 	not handled properly. When a char of the delim string was found in	the text it was deleted.
patch from  Paul Mahon to	add PEER_ADDR to cgi env

Mon Jun 7, 2004 Version 1.48 released
This release contains both bugfixes as well as som minor new features. There was also a fairly ugly security hole in the example code which describes file uploads found and fixed.
A Bug in yaws_api:request_url/1 was found by Einar Karttunen. The function didn't handle well the case with explicit port numbers in the URI. (klacke)
Fixed the appmod code so that users of yaws_api:setconf/1 doesn't have to bother with the cahnge in internal representation of appmods. (klacke)
Moved phpexe config variable from the sconf to the gconf, it doesn't make sence to have different phpexe paths for different virt servers. Users with old configs will get a warning when tying to specify a phpexe inside a virt server instead of inside the global config area. (klacke)
New feature called "yssi". Yaws server side include. It's now possible to let the out/1 function return a tuple {yssi, PathToYawsFile.yaws"}.  The new yaws file will be fully expanded, compiled and in general handled as a yaws file. This feature can probably be used to build all kinds of different cool stuff. (klacke)
yaws_session_server ttl patch from Rob.Schmersel
Patch from  Fredrik Linder to make it easier to integrate yaws into apps that don't use the otp application framework at all. 
As usual updates both to the wiki and the webmail app by (jb)
Patch from Jocke Grebeno which handles ssi support for ehtml code, not just ascii. We can now return  {ssi, "@@", file.html, [{"FOO", "bar"}, {"BAZ", {ehtml, {p, [], "saab"}}}]}  and it returns the expected. Documented is ssi.yaws.
Security vulnerability in upload.yaws found by (mbj) 

Thu May 27, 2004 Version 1.47 released

Debian  support (David Welton)
Embedded mode fixes (Jimmy Olgeni)
Don't create no logs at all when logging is turned off bugfix (Jimmy Olgeni)
SSL and large POSTs fix (cschultz)
Compression and keep alive fix (cschultz)
As usual, several fixes to the wiki and the webmail app (jbevemyr)
An XSS vulnerability (lpsmith)
Rewrote the url spliting (again) and also backed off from the redir when we get http://www.a.com/ and index.html exists. It's better to ship the file directly instead of sending a redir. (klacke)
Reworked (and documented) the appmods a bit (klacke)
Added a command line flag (yaws -ls) which lists existing yaws servers and their status on localhost. (klacke)

Fri Apr 16, 2004 Version 1.45 released
Minor bugfix release fixing up the some odd bugs introduced in the 1.43 rewite.

Mar 18, 2004 Version 1.43 released
This is a major release. Not so much for added functionality as for internal rewrites of the code. The release contains the following:
Compression support using zlib. Still experimental. (cschultz)
Minor bugfixes in the reverse proxy. This code is still not ready (klacke)
Added a specific auth log which logs good and bad HTTP auth requests.
QNX port (cschatz@networkadvantage.biz)
Beautification of dir listings (cschultz)
Never let ehtml generate extra spaces where it is not entirely correct (patch from tomas abrahamsson)
Webmail app, Completed support for attachments, proper esacping, faster listing of large mboxes. Added sorting of mails (jb)
Date header bug (chandru)
postvar put/get bug fixed (hal snyder)
Added yaws_api:query_url(Arg) which reconstructs the url from the original GET request.
Added the "id = Key" configuration parameter. Earlier when we were running multiple yaws servers on the same machine, they had to run with different uid since yaws was writing temporary files under /tmp/yaws/${uid}. This is now changed and if we want 2 _different_ yaws servers on the same machine they must be given different "id" in their respective config files. The yaws ctl scripts, such as yaws -s and friends now have an extra (optional) "-j id" flag to control which specific instance of Yaws is ment.
Added explicit support for Content-Length header from .yaws files for applications that require Content-Length instead of chunked encodings.
Changed the #sconf{} and #gconf{} records so that all the booleans in those 2 records are now a bitmask flag. This is a slightly backwards incompatible change and it affects those that use Yaws in embedded mode where the #sconf and #gconf records are explicitly manipulated. It sholdn't be a big deal to change though.
Workaround buggy otp error_logger_file_h which truncates the report file whenever it is reopened. 
Removed the calls inside the server that were doing list_to_atom/1 We were suceptible to DOS attacks. This is unfortunately a backwards incompatible change since it affects the return value from API functions yaws_api:parse_query/1 and yaws_api:parse_post/1. They both used to return lists on the form of {Key, Val} tuples where Key was an atom. It is now a string. There is a configuration option for yaws.conf which keeps the old (broken) behaviour. 
Optimized url parsing and removed at least one call to lists:flatten/1 in the fast path. 
Better support for old Netscape and the Connection: Keep-Alive header.
More beautiful trace output. Try "yaws -i -x -T"
More and better debug support.
New install procedure with a more interesting yaws.conf template generated.
Updated the ssl test certs that come with yaws. The old ones had expired.

Did away with the idiotic calls to id -u as well as the the broken grep in /etc/passwd. Also ensured that .yaws files with a query part don't end up in the cache. They need to be reparsed every time
Fixed probles with paths that had a query part ending up in the cache

Skip empty space after an erl chunk in a .yaws file
Handle http_error which is generated by the inet_drv.c code. This assumes a patch to the inet_drv.c that actually generates a http_error in this case. Default erl hangs there. Here is the inet_drv.c diff

Jun 19, version 0.51 released. Lot's of fixes.
Return status 303 when browser asks for a dir URL without a trailing / in the http request. I've always wondered why apache does this. Now I know ... otherwise the relative URLs in /dir/index.html will be wrong when the browser tries to get them.   Utilize this feature when listing dirs now, generate relative urls instead of absolute.
Removed the default_server_on_this_ip option, the first virthosted server  in the config will be default if no Host: header is present
Made the Host: check to check for Host: host:port instead of just host when a server is run on a non-standard port. The browsers seem to set the Host: field to host:port
Tobbe added the -r flag to the startscript
Changed yaws_api:parse_post_data/1 so that it takes an arg struct as argument instead of querydata and added support for multipart form data in the process.
