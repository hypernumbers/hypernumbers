Release Notes V 2.0

Starling which was previously hosted at http://code.google.com/p/starling/ has been brought into the Hypernumbers repositories at GitHub at http://github.com/hypernumbers/starling

In this release multiple instances of the port driver can be loaded to provide to provided additional throughput.

The number of instances is determined by the environment variables in the starling.app file.

The environment variable 'poolsize' determines how many ports will be loaded and the environment variable 'group' determines the name of the pg2 group that the starling_server processes will be part of.

The pg2 group is a global group and starling can now be deployed as a multiserver capability.

********************************************************
Starling is a Unicode text processing library for Erlang.
It's based on ICU (http://icu-project.org/), which you need to have installed to use Starling.

`port install icu` with MacPorts on OSX
`apt-get install libicu38 libicu-dev` on Ubuntu

You also need to have Ruby and Rake installed (the build script uses Rake).

To compile, just run `rake` from Starling's root directory.

Once you've compiled Starling, start the Erlang shell with:
`erl -pa ~/path/to/starling/ebin`
  
You can then use Starling like this:
  
  1> application:start(starling_app).
  ok
  2> S = ustring:new("hello").
  <<0,104,0,101,0,108,0,108,0,111>>
  3> S2 = ustring:upcase(S).
  <<0,72,0,69,0,76,0,76,0,79>>
  4> ustring:pr(S2).
  "HELLO"

There's a couple of simple demos under demos/. You may also want to take a look at tests/.
