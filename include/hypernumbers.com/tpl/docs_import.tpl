    <p>You can import your own spreadsheet into hypernumbers, there are some known
        errors with the import, but we will be fixing these in upcoming releases</p>

    <p>To import your spreadsheet, go to File -> Upload Spreadsheet, then use the file chooser
    to pick your xls file, this will then be automatically uploaded and will overwrite the 
    currently open websheet.</p>
