    <h2>Binary SVN Repository</h2><hr />

    <p>We maintain an SVN repository that stores the current binaries. these will be
        updated more often than the releases and are a way for developers to get
        access to immediate bug fixes and functionality.</p>
    
    <p> The url for the repository is </p>
    <code>http://svn.hypernumbers.com/code</code>

    <p>The credentials for the repository are</p>
    <code>user: alpha<br />pass: hypernumbers</code>

    <p>The repository contains the same setup as the packaged releases, the 
    documentation will be updated along with the code and all other documentation
    refers to both the packaged and svn versions</p>

    <p>Windows users are recommended to use

    in sync with updates</p>
    <p>Linux / Mac users can simply type the following into the shell</p>
